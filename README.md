## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with our Chat App, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies.

### Installation 🔧

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the client directory and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

3. Do the same for the server directory:
```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

### Running the Application 🏃‍♂️

To run the application, you'll need to start both the client and the server.

#### Starting the Client 🖥️

In the client directory, run:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### Starting the Server 🌐

In the server directory, run:
```bash
npm start
```

This will compile the TypeScript files and start the Express server on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Features ✨

- Real-time messaging 💬
- User authentication and management 🔒
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices 📲

## Building for Production 🏗️

When you're ready to build the client for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle the React app in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance.
