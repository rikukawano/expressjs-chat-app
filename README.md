# Chat App

Welcome to our Chat App! This application is designed to provide a seamless and interactive chat experience. Built with modern technologies like React for the frontend and Express for the backend, it integrates Firebase for real-time database operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with our Chat App, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the client directory and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

3. Do the same for the server directory:
```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, you'll need to start both the client and the server.

#### Starting the Client

In the client directory, run:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the React application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### Starting the Server

In the server directory, run:
```bash
npm start
```
This will compile the TypeScript files and start the Express server on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Features

- Real-time messaging
- User authentication and management
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Building for Production

When you're ready to build the client for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will bundle the React app in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance.
